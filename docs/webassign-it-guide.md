## Session Setup

### Overview

This guide is written under the assumption that you’ve made a session tracking sheet as outlined in the Organization guide in this folder. If you haven’t done that yet, go back and follow the steps in that guide first.

### Instructions
1. In your session tracking sheet, hide all of the courses except for the ones that use WebAssign.
2. Go to [https://www.webassign.net/](https://www.webassign.net/) and log in with the username (cconline@cougars.ccis.edu) and IDT shared accounts password
    1. Find the Master section for the course that you are setting up for. (At the time of writing, CHEM/PHYS 108 is the only course we offer that uses WebAssign.) The Online master for this course is called CHEM/PHYS 108, section Master. The CCG master is called CHEM/PHYS 108, section CTEP master section CTEP.
    2. Click on Reschedule Assignments.
    3. For each assignment, click on the switch in the Scheduled column to unschedule, then click Save.
3. Click on Edit Class Settings on the master course that you just unscheduled all of the assignments for.
    1. Now set Date Visible To Students to the start date of the session.
    2. Set Last Date Visible To Students to one week after the end date of the session.
    3. Click Save at the bottom of the page.
4. Find the master course in the list again and click on Reschedule Assignments. Click on the switch in the Scheduled column to re-activate them.
5.	Find the master course in the list again, and click on Copy To New Sections.

    In the Section field, enter the section and session of the course, e.g. “DEA 20Sprg1.”
    Find the instructor in the dropdown menu and select them.
    
    If the instructor of the course isn’t listed in the dropdown menu, Cengage will need to create an account for them. Contact Jeff Pitts ([jeff.pitts@cengage.com](mailto:jeff.pitts@cengage.com)) with the instructor’s name and Columbia College email address and he’ll get them set up.
    
    Click **Copy Section Schedule**.
